## Two Sum Problem Explanation

### Problem:
Given a list of numbers and a target, return the indices of two numbers that add up to the target.

### Approach:
1. Use a dictionary to store the numbers we've already seen along with their indices.
2. For each number, calculate the value we need to reach the target (complement).
3. If the complement is already in the dictionary, return its index and the current index.

### Time Complexity: O(n)
- Only one pass through the list.
